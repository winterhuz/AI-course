# Windows11 with ubuntu 20.04

first of all double system unlike virtual machine, it doesn't do anything with your computer's efficiency

only problem is the space of your disk, double system means two work space, and of course two storage space

usually 100G is enough for it.


To make those happend, first check the storage space.

for windows 11, check main menu for computer manager.
